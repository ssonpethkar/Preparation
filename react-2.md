# 1. What is React?
  - React is a open source javascript library which is used to building user interface(UI) for SPA(single page application)
  - React used component based architecture and virtual DOM for faster rendering.
  - Its allows developer to create reusable UI components 
  - React developed by facebook in 2013. 

# 2. What is useMemo ?
  - useMemo is a react hook that helps optimize performace by `memoizing the result of a computations`. 
  - It only recalculates the memoized value when one of its dependencies changes.

# 3. What are the features of React ?
  - Uses virtual DOM so faster and lightwight 
  - component based architecture 
  - Decalrative UI 
  - Unidirectional data flow 
  - Hooks  


# 4. What is JSX ?
  - JSX stands for javascript XML 
  - JSX is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in javascript 

# 5. What is DOM ?
  - DOM stands for document object model 
  - DOM represents the web page as a tree-like structure which allows to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of web pages.

# 6. What is Virtual Dom ?
  - Virtual DOM is a lightwight copy of real DOM
  - React keeps copy of real DOM( virtual DOM) in memory, when changes occur 
    1. Updates DOM 
    2. Compares new virtual DOM to  previous one (used diffing algorithm for comparison)
    3. Applies only neccessary changes to the real DOM (reconcillation) 

# 7. What is component life cycle of React class component ?
  Component life cycle methods are special methods that get called at various stages of component life cycle
   
  In class component there are `3 phases` : 
    1. `Mounting phase : component is added in DOM`
      In mounting phase there are `4 methods`
        - constructor()
        - static getDerivedStateFromProps
        - renders()
        - componentDidMount

    2. `Updating phase : state or props changes`
      In updating phase there are `5 methods`
        - static getDerivedStateFromProps()
        - shouldComponentUpdate()
        - renders()
        - getSnapShotBeforeUpdate()
        - componentDidUpdate()

    3. Unmounting phase : Cleanup (Clearing timers (setTimeout, setInterval), Unsubscribing from events (WebSocket, window listeners))
      1 method 
        - componentWillUnmount()
        

# 8. What are fragments in react ?
  - Fragment is a group a list of children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM
  -  `WHY` : to avoid unnnecessary <div> wrappers


# 9. What are props in react ?
  - Props is a way to pass data from parent to child components 
  - Props are immutable (read-only inputs) 

# 10. What are synthetic events in react ?
  - synthetic events are React's cross browser wrapper around browsers native event system 
  - They normalize the events so they behave consistently across the different browsers. 


# 11. What are the difference between Package.json and Package.lock.json ?
  package.json :
    - used to list project dependencies and scripts 
    - maintained by developers or via npm install
    - its not affects reproducibility (allows versions diff across installs)
    - contains version ranges

  package-lock.json : 
    - used to locks the versions of installed packages
    - maintained by automatically generated by npm
    - its affects reproducibility ( ensures consistent installs across enviornments)
    - exact versions 


# 12. What are the differences between client side and server side rendering ?
  Client side :
    - in client side its rendering location is browsers 
    - initial load speed slower
    - SEO friendliness Poor ( without additional setup)
    - interactivity : starts after JS loads 

  Server side :
    - in server side its rendering location is server
    - initial load speed faster 
    - SEO friendliness good
    - Interactivity Immediate ( after HTML load)


# 13. What is state in Reactjs?
  - state is an object that holds dynamic data for a component. when state change component re-renders 
  - state is current data of the component 
  - state is mutable
  - used to handle internal changes 
  - can be updated using hook ot setState()

# 14. What are props ?
  - Props is a way to pass data from parent components to child components 
  - Props are immutable 
  - used for send data to the component 
  - can't be modified within components

# 15. What are the differences between State and Props in react ?
  # state :
  - State is an objects that holds dynamic data for a component. when state changes components re-renders 
  - State is current data of the ccomponent
  - State is mutable 
  - used for handle internal changes
  - can be updated using setState() or hook 

  # props: 
  - Props are a way to pass data from parent component to child component 
  - props are immutable 
  - used to sent data to components 
  - can't be modified within components  

# 16. What is props drilling ?
  - prop drilling is a process of passing down props through multiple layers of a component 
  - props drilling occurs when data is passed through many nested components even if intermediate component don't required that data - they only forwad it.

  # why to avoid ?
  - maintenance : prop drilling can make code harder to maintain to changes an data flow require updates across multiple components
  - complexity : it increase code complexity and reduces code readability 
  - debugging : debugging becomes challenging when props need to be traced through numerous components

  # how to avoid 
  - using context API
  - using redux
  - using component composition
  - using callback functions
  - using custom hooks


# 17. What are the disadvantages of props drilling and How we can avoid props drilling ?
  # Disadvantages : 
  - code becomes hard to read and maintain
  - intermediate components are forced to accepts and forward props 
  - Tightly coupled components 

  # How avoid?
  - react context api
  - using redux
  - custom hooks 
  - react component composition 
  - using callback functions

# 18. What are Pure components in React ?
  - A pure components in a react is a component that only re-renders when its props and state change, using a shallow comparison

# 19. Whatare Refâ€™s in React?
  - refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or react elements directly
  - Usages : 
    1. managing focus
    2. text selections 
    3. animations 
    4. integrating 3rd party libraries

# 20. What is meant by forward ref ?
  - forwardRef is a technique to passing refs through a component to one of its child DOM nodes
  # usages :  
    - when a parent component needs to interact with a child nodes

# 21. What are Error boundaries ?
  - Error bindries are react component that catch javascript erros in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app.

# 22. What are Higher order components in react or HOC?
  - HOC stands for higher order components 
  - Higher order components are a function that can passed component as argument and returns a new component with additional features.
                                                `or`
  - Higher order components are a function takes a component as an argument  and return a new component with additional features.
  - HOC is used to reuse code, make code more modular and reusable
  - HOC is often used authorisation, authentication and caching

# 23. What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components ? 
  Controlled components : 
    - data stored in react state
    - we can access through useState and onChange
    - react should be controlled

  Uncontrolled components : 
    - data stored in DOM( via refs)
    - using useRef().current.value we can access 
    - react should not be cntrolled


# 24. What is useCallback ?
  - useCallback is a react hook that returns a memoized version of the callback functions, which only changes if its dependencies change

  WHY we use:
    - prevents unnecessary re-creation of functions- useful when passing callbacks to memoized components  

# 25. What are the differences between useMemo and useCallback ?
  useMemo : 
    - useMemo is a react hook that helps optimize performance by memoizing the result of computations. it only calculates the memoized value when one of its dependencies changes. 
    - its returns memoize value 
    - used for cache expensive

  useCallback : 
    - useCallback is react hook that returns a memoized version of callback function, which only changes if its dependencies change. 
    - its returns memoized function 
    - used for cache event handlers or callbacks 

# 26. What are keys in React ?
  - keys help react identify which items in a list have changed, are added or removed . 
  - They must be unique among siblings 

  WHY important : 
    - helps react to optimize rendering ( using reconcillation)
    - prevents unnecessary re-renders or bugs. 

# What is redux and why it is used 
  - Redux is a state management library for javascript apps, commonly used in react. 
  - it helps you manage application state in a single global store 

  Why : 
    - centralized state management 
    - predictable state updates 
    - easier debugging and testing 
    - Middleware support 


# 27. What is Lazy loading in React ?
  - lazy loading in react refers to the technique of loading components when only they are needed, rather than the loading everything at when apps starts. 
  - This helps improve initial load performance reducing the size of javascript module.

  WHY use : 
    - reduces initial bundle size
    - speeds up page loading time 
    - optimize performance for large apps or multipage UI's
  - 

# 28. What is suspense in React ?
# 29. What are custom hooks ?
  - custom hooks is a javascript function that starts with use and allows you to reuse  `stateful` logic between components

  WHY use : 
    - abstract and reuse logic (e.g form handling, fetching)
    - keep components clean 

# what is reconcillation in react ?
  - Reconcillation is the process react uses to update the DOM efficiently when a components state or props change.
