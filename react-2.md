# 1. What is React?
  - React is a open source javascript library which is used to building user interface(UI) for SPA(single page application)
  - React used component based architecture and virtual DOM for faster rendering.
  - Its allows developer to create reusable UI components 
  - React developed by facebook in 2013. 

# 2. What is useMemo ?
  - useMemo is a react hook that helps optimize performace by `memoizing the result of a computations`. 
  - It only recalculates the memoized value when one of its dependencies changes.

# 3. What are the features of React ?
  - Uses virtual DOM so faster and lightwight 
  - component based architecture 
  - Decalrative UI 
  - Unidirectional data flow 
  - Hooks  


# 4. What is JSX ?
  - JSX stands for javascript XML 
  - JSX is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in javascript 

# 5. What is DOM ?
  - DOM stands for document object model 
  - DOM represents the web page as a tree-like structure which allows to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of web pages.

# 6. What is Virtual Dom ?
  - Virtual DOM is a lightwight copy of real DOM
  - React keeps copy of real DOM( virtual DOM) in memory, when changes occur 
    1. Updates DOM 
    2. Compares new virtual DOM to  previous one (used diffing algorithm for comparison)
    3. Applies only neccessary changes to the real DOM (reconcillation) 

# 7. What is component life cycle of React class component ?
  Component life cycle methods are special methods that get called at various stages of component life cycle
   
  In class component there are `3 phases` : 
    1. `Mounting phase : component is added in DOM`
      In mounting phase there are `4 methods`
        - constructor()
        - static getDerivedStateFromProps
        - renders()
        - componentDidMount

    2. `Updating phase : state or props changes`
      In updating phase there are `5 methods`
        - static getDerivedStateFromProps()
        - shouldComponentUpdate()
        - renders()
        - getSnapShotBeforeUpdate()
        - componentDidUpdate()

    3. Unmounting phase : Cleanup (Clearing timers (setTimeout, setInterval), Unsubscribing from events (WebSocket, window listeners))
      1 method 
        - componentWillUnmount()
        

# 8. What are fragments in react ?
  - Fragment is a group a list of children elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM
  -  `WHY` : to avoid unnnecessary <div> wrappers


# 9. What are props in react ?
  - Props is a way to pass data from parent to child components 
  - Props are immutable (read-only inputs) 

# 10. What are synthetic events in react ?
  - synthetic events are React's cross browser wrapper around browsers native event system 
  - They normalize the events so they behave consistently across the different browsers. 


# 11. What are the difference between Package.json and Package.lock.json ?
  package.json :
    - used to list project dependencies and scripts 
    - maintained by developers or via npm install
    - its not affects reproducibility (allows versions diff across installs)
    - contains version ranges

  package-lock.json : 
    - used to locks the versions of installed packages
    - maintained by automatically generated by npm
    - its affects reproducibility ( ensures consistent installs across enviornments)
    - exact versions 


# 12. What are the differences between client side and server side rendering ?
  Client side :
    - in client side its rendering location is browsers 
    - initial load speed slower
    - SEO friendliness Poor ( without additional setup)
    - interactivity : starts after JS loads 

  Server side :
    - in server side its rendering location is server
    - initial load speed faster 
    - SEO friendliness good
    - Interactivity Immediate ( after HTML load)


# 13. What is state in Reactjs?
  - state is an object that holds dynamic data for a component. when state change component re-renders 
  - state is current data of the component 
  - state is mutable
  - used to handle internal changes 
  - can be updated using hook ot setState()

# 14. What are props ?
  - Props is a way to pass data from parent components to child components 
  - Props are immutable 
  - used for send data to the component 
  - can't be modified within components

# 15. What are the differences between State and Props in react ?
  # state :
  - State is an objects that holds dynamic data for a component. when state changes components re-renders 
  - State is current data of the ccomponent
  - State is mutable 
  - used for handle internal changes
  - can be updated using setState() or hook 

  # props: 
  - Props are a way to pass data from parent component to child component 
  - props are immutable 
  - used to sent data to components 
  - can't be modified within components  

# 16. What is props drilling ?
  - prop drilling is a process of passing down props through multiple layers of a component 
  - props drilling occurs when data is passed through many nested components even if intermediate component don't required that data - they only forwad it.

  # why to avoid ?
  - maintenance : prop drilling can make code harder to maintain to changes an data flow require updates across multiple components
  - complexity : it increase code complexity and reduces code readability 
  - debugging : debugging becomes challenging when props need to be traced through numerous components

  # how to avoid 
  - using context API
  - using redux
  - using component composition
  - using callback functions
  - using custom hooks


# 17. What are the disadvantages of props drilling and How we can avoid props drilling ?
  # Disadvantages : 
  - code becomes hard to read and maintain
  - intermediate components are forced to accepts and forward props 
  - Tightly coupled components 

  # How avoid?
  - react context api
  - using redux
  - custom hooks 
  - react component composition 
  - using callback functions

# 18. What are Pure components in React ?
  - A pure components in a react is a component that only re-renders when its props and state change, using a shallow comparison

# 19. Whatare Refâ€™s in React?
  - refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or react elements directly
  - Usages : 
    1. managing focus
    2. text selections 
    3. animations 
    4. integrating 3rd party libraries

# 20. What is meant by forward ref ?
  - forwardRef is a technique to passing refs through a component to one of its child DOM nodes
  # usages :  
    - when a parent component needs to interact with a child nodes

# 21. What are Error boundaries ?
  - Error bindries are react component that catch javascript erros in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire app.

# 22. What are Higher order components in react or HOC?
  - HOC stands for higher order components 
  - Higher order components are a function that can passed component as argument and returns a new component with additional features.
                                                `or`
  - Higher order components are a function takes a component as an argument  and return a new component with additional features.
  - HOC is used to reuse code, make code more modular and reusable
  - HOC is often used authorisation, authentication and caching

# 23. What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components ? 
  Controlled components : 
    - data stored in react state
    - we can access through useState and onChange
    - react should be controlled

  Uncontrolled components : 
    - data stored in DOM( via refs)
    - using useRef().current.value we can access 
    - react should not be cntrolled


# 24. What is useCallback ?
  - useCallback is a react hook that returns a memoized version of the callback functions, which only changes if its dependencies change

  WHY we use:
    - prevents unnecessary re-creation of functions- useful when passing callbacks to memoized components  

# 25. What are the differences between useMemo and useCallback ?
  useMemo : 
    - useMemo is a react hook that helps optimize performance by memoizing the result of computations. it only calculates the memoized value when one of its dependencies changes. 
    - its returns memoize value 
    - used for cache expensive

  useCallback : 
    - useCallback is react hook that returns a memoized version of callback function, which only changes if its dependencies change. 
    - its returns memoized function 
    - used for cache event handlers or callbacks 

# 26. What are keys in React ?
  - keys help react identify which items in a list have changed, are added or removed . 
  - They must be unique among siblings 

  WHY important : 
    - helps react to optimize rendering ( using reconcillation)
    - prevents unnecessary re-renders or bugs. 

# What is redux and why it is used 
  - Redux is a state management library for javascript apps, commonly used in react. 
  - it helps you manage application state in a single global store 

  Why : 
    - centralized state management 
    - predictable state updates 
    - easier debugging and testing 
    - Middleware support 


# 27. What is Lazy loading in React ?
  - lazy loading in react refers to the technique of loading components when only they are needed, rather than the loading everything at when apps starts. 
  - This helps improve initial load performance reducing the size of javascript module.

  WHY use : 
    - reduces initial bundle size
    - speeds up page loading time 
    - optimize performance for large apps or multipage UI's
  - 

# 28. What is suspense in React ?
  - React.Suspense is a component used to handle the loading state of components that are loaded asynchronously(eg. via React.lazy, data fetching with framework like relay or other concurrent features)
  - Suspense wraps this lazy component and shows the fallback UI (like a loading spinner) until the component finishes loading.

  # Why use Suspense?
  - Improves performance by loading components only when needed.
  - Better user experience with graceful loading indicators.
  - Works with data fetching and streaming in newer versions of React (e.g., React Server Components, Relay).

 
# 29. What are custom hooks ?
  - custom hooks is a javascript function that starts with use and allows you to reuse  `stateful` logic between components

  WHY use : 
    - abstract and reuse logic (e.g form handling, fetching)
    - keep components clean 

# what is reconcillation in react ?
  - Reconcillation is the process react uses to update the DOM efficiently when a components state or props change.

# what are react hooks? what are the top react hooks?
  - React hooks are inbuilt functions provided by react that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features.
  - Before hooks, class components lifecycle methods were used to maintain state in React applications. 
  - to use react hook first we have to import it from react library

  1. useState : state
  2. useEffect : side effect 
  3. useContext : Context
  4. useReducer : Complex state
  5. useCallback : Memoization
  6. useMemo : Performance
  7. useRef : refs
  8. useLayoutEffect : Synchronous side effects 
  
# what is react fibre 
  - react fibre is a reconcillation algorithm and rerendering engine introduced in React 16 to improve rendering performance and enable advanced features like concurrent rendering, suspence , errorboundries. 

  * âœ… Why React Fiber Was Introduced
    - The old reconciliation algorithm (pre-React 16) was `synchronous` and `recursive`, meaning large component trees could block the main thread and make the UI unresponsive.

  * React Fiber solves this by:
    - Making the rendering process interruptible  
    - Breaking down work into units
    - Prioritizing updates
    - Supporting pausing, resuming, or canceling work 

  * ðŸ“¦ Fiber Enables These Key Features

| Feature                  | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrent Rendering** | Rendering is no longer blocking; React can split rendering into chunks. |
| **Suspense & Lazy**      | Pause rendering until a component or data is ready.                     |
| **Time Slicing**         | Break large renders into smaller units for responsiveness.              |
| **Error Boundaries**     | Catch and recover from component errors without crashing the whole app. |

**Summary**
| Feature        | Description                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fiber Engine   | Internal engine allowing asynchronous, prioritized rendering     |
| Enables        | Concurrent rendering, Suspense, lazy loading, responsive updates |
| Benefits       | Better performance, smoother UX, fewer UI freezes                |
| You use it via | React features like `useTransition`, `Suspense`, etc.            |

    
# 30. What is useReducer hook ?
  - useReducer is same as useState. its a alternative. 
  - it is used for complex state logic

  ```jsx
  const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case "increment": return { count: state.count + 1 };
      case "decrement": return { count: state.count - 1 };
      default: return state;
    }
  };

  function Counter() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });

    return (
      <>
        <p>{state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>+</button>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>-</button>
      </>
    );
  }
``


# 31. What are Portals in react ?
- Portals let you render children into a DOM node outside the parent component.

ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)

function Modal({ children }) {
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    <div className="modal">{children}</div>,
    document.getElementById("modal-root")
  );
}
```

# 32. What is context in react ?

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return <ThemeButton />;
}

function ThemeButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>Click Me</button>;
}

```

# 34. What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?

```jsx 
function Parent() {
  const handleData = (data) => console.log(data);
  return <Child sendData={handleData} />;
}

function Child({ sendData }) {
  return <button onClick={() => sendData("Hello Parent")}>Send</button>;
}

```

# 40. Practical question: How to send the data from child component to parent using useRef ?
```jsx
function Parent() {
  const childRef = useRef();

  const getData = () => {
    console.log(childRef.current.value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Child ref={childRef} />
      <button onClick={getData}>Get Data</button>
    </>
  );
}

const Child = forwardRef((props, ref) => (
  <input ref={ref} placeholder="Type here" />
));

```

function Button({ label }) {
  return <button>{label}</button>;
}

Button.propTypes = {
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

```

  - create elements : create a new element
  - clone elements : clones and enhances an existing elements 

# 51. When to use useState and useReducer?
  - useState is used for simple state ( form fields, toggles)
  - useReducer for complex state logic( multiple state, state transition)

# 52. What are protected routes in react ?
  - Routes that require authentications

## 1. Lifecycle Methods in Class Components 

| **Phase**          | **Method**                          | **When to Use**                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mounting**       | `constructor()`                     | Initialize state, bind methods (rare now)           |
|                    | `static getDerivedStateFromProps()` | Update state based on props (rare)                  |
|                    | `render()`                          | Required method â€“ returns JSX                       |
|                    | `componentDidMount()`               | Fetch data, set up subscriptions or event listeners |
| **Updating**       | `shouldComponentUpdate()`           | Optimize performance by controlling re-renders      |
|                    | `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`         | Read DOM info before update (e.g., scroll position) |
|                    | `componentDidUpdate()`              | Act on prop/state changes, re-fetch data            |
| **Unmounting**     | `componentWillUnmount()`            | Cleanup (cancel timers, remove listeners, etc.)     |
| **Error Handling** | `componentDidCatch()`               | Catch rendering errors in child components          |


2. Lifecycle Equivalents in Functional Components


| **Class Method**          | **Functional Equivalent**                                       | **Usage Example**                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `componentDidMount`       | `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`                                  | Fetch data, start subscriptions         |
| `componentDidUpdate`      | `useEffect(() => { ... }, [dependencies])`                      | Run logic on specific prop/state change |
| `componentWillUnmount`    | `useEffect(() => { return () => {...}; }, [])`                  | Cleanup timers, listeners, etc.         |
| `shouldComponentUpdate`   | Manual memoization: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`      | Performance optimization                |
| `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` | Rare: use `useRef()` for snapshotting values                    | Capture previous values                 |
| `componentDidCatch`       | `ErrorBoundary` must still be a **class component** (as of now) | Error boundaries                        |
