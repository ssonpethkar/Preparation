# 1. what is react 
    - react is a open source javascript library to building user interfaces . It is used to creating reusable UI components for single page applications . It is mainted by facebook from 2013. 
    - react uses components based architechture and virtual dom to render the user interface efficiently 
    - It is also uses for complex user interfaces and mobile applications .

# features of react 
    - components based architecture
    - virtual dom
    - one way data binding
    - declarative UI
    - efficient rendering
    - large community and ecosystem
    - easy to learn and use 

# advantages of react
- fast and efficient rendering
- easy to learn and use
- large community and ecosystem
- reusable UI components
- easy to maintain and update
- supports server side rendering
- supports mobile applications

# disadvantages of react
- steep learning curve for complex applications
- not suitable for very simple applications
- requires additional libraries for routing and state management
- can be slow for very large applications

# use cases of react
- building complex user interfaces
- building single page applications
- building mobile applications
- building real time applications
- building web applications with server side rendering

# what is react router  
    - react router is a library for client side routing in react applications . It allows to navigate between different routes in a single page application . It is used to create a single page application with multiple routes .
    - react router uses a declarative API to define routes and navigate between them . It also provides a lot of features such as route parameters , query parameters , and route guards .

# react query 
- react query is a library for managing data fetching and caching in react applications . It provides a lot of features such as automatic caching , optimistic updates , and error handling .   

# graphQL
- graphQL is a query language for APIs . It allows to define a schema for data and query it using a specific syntax . It is used to build robust and scalable APIs .
