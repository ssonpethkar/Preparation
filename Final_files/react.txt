# 1. What is React?
	- React is developed by facebook in Mar 2013
	- React is open source javascript library for building user interfaces for crating single page web application. 
	- React uses component based architecture and virtual dom for faster rendering 
	- It allows developer to create reusable UI components 
    Features : 
	- Using component based architecture 
	- uses virtual DOM for faster rendering 
	- uses Hooks for state management and lifecycle features 
	- JSX 
	- Redux
    Advantages : 
	- Strong community support
	- SEO friendly 
	- uses virtual DOM for efficiently updates and faster rendering 
	- Can be used client side rendering and server side rendering 
	- good performance 
	- Easy integration with other libraries and framework 
	 			
# 3. What are the features of React ?
	- uses component based architecture 
	- it can be used virtual dom for faster rendering 
	- unidirectional data flow
	- declarative UI 
	- JSX  
	- hooks 

# 4. What is JSX ?
	- JSX stands for javascript XML 
	- JSX is a syntax extension to write html like code in javascript
	- Browser doesn't understand JSX they use transpiler as babel. Babel converts jsx into javascript to understand browser 

# 5. What is DOM ?
	- DOM stands for document object model 
	- DOM represents web page as a tree like structure which allows to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of the web page

# 6. What is Virtual Dom ?
	- Virtual dom is a lightweight copy of real dom 
	- react keeps copy of real dom (means virtual dom) in memory, when changes occur 
		- firstly react updates DOM
		- then compares new virtual DOM to previous one ( using diffing algorithm for comparison)
		- then they applies only necessary changes to the real DOM ( using reconcillation)  

# what is reconcillation ?
	- reconcillation is the process react uses to updates DOM efficiently when components state and props change.

# 8. What are fragments in react ?
	- fragment is a way to group a list of child component without adding extra node to the DOM.

# 9. What are props in react ?
	- Props is a way to pass parent component data to child component data 
	- props is immutable 
	- In props, data handled from parent component and it passed down 


# 13. What is state in Reactjs?
	- state is an object that holds dynamic data for the component data when state changes then it rerenders 
	- state is mutable 
	- In state, data is handled within component 
 
# 14. What are props ?
	- Props is a way to pass data from parent component to child component
	- props is immutable 
	- we can't modified props data in their child component
	- In props, data handled by parent component and it passing downs
 
# 15. What are the differences between State and Props in react ?
	state : 
		- state is an object that holds dynamic data of the component when state changes then rerenders
		- state is mutable
		- In state, data is handled within component
	Props : 
		- Props is a way to pass data from parent component to child component 
		- props is immutable 
		- in props, data is handled from parent component and passed downs

# 16. What is props drilling ?
	- prop drilling is the process of passing down props to multiple layer of component
	- props drilling occurs when we pass data as a props to multiple nested component if intermediate component doesn't need that data they only accept it and forward to another component. 

# 17. What are the disadvantages of props drilling and How we can avoid props drilling ?
	We can avoid prop drilling 
		- using context API, 
		- using useCallback 
		- using redux 
		- using component composition 
		- using custom hooks 
		- using lifting state up 
	Disadvantages 	
		- hard to debug if any issue arises 
		- code become hard to read and maintain
		- intermediate component forced to accept it and forward it 

# 18. What are Pure components in React ?
	- Pure components is the component only re-renders when its state and props changes using shallow comparisons

# 21. What are Error boundaries ?
	- Error boundries are the react component that catch javascript error in their child component , log those errors and shows fallback UI instead of falling entire app.

# 22. What are Higher order components in react ?
	- Higher order component is a function that passed component as an argument and returns a new component with extra additional features 

# 23. What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components ? 
	- Controlled components : 
		- Controlled component is a form input elements like select, textarea , input etc whose value is handled by react state 
		- React has full controlled of the component 
		- we can access state using useSTate and update by onchange on each change 
		- controlled component is used when we need full access of forms , form validation, conditional input, real time data

	- Uncontrolled components : 
		- Uncontrolled component is a form input element that manages its own state internally using DOM 
		- react reads only its value if they needed in Uncontrolled components 
		- we can access its state using refs 
		- uncontrolled component is used for simple forms and dom integrations

# 26. What are keys in React ?
	- Keys helps to identify which items in a list has changed, removed and added.
	- they must be unique among the siblings

# 27. What is Lazy loading in React ?
	- lazy loading refers a technique of loading components when only they are needed , rather than the loading everything at when apps starts
      Why USE : 
	- reduces initial bundle size 
	- speeds up page loading time
	- optimize performance for large apps or multiple UI's 

# 28. What is suspense in React ?
	- React.suspense is a component used to handle the loading state of components that are loaded asynchronously 
    ( for ex. via react.lazy, data fetching with framework like relay or other concurrent features ) 
 
# 29. What are custom hooks ?
	- custom hooks is a javascript function that starts with use and allows you to reuse stateful logic between components . 

# 31. What are Portals in react ?
	- Portals let you render child component outside the parent component 

# 38. What are the different ways to pass data from child component to parent component in react ?
	- using context API ( global or shared ) => shared state in deeply nested trees
	- using state management libraries ( redux, zustand , etc) => centralized and app-wide state
	- using callback functions ( most common and recommended) => simple prop based communication
	- using useRef passed from parent => accessing childs internal value 
	- using forwardRef and useImperativeHandle => calling child function from parent

#  What are the different ways to pass data from  parent component to child component  in react ? 
	- props => direct parent to child component
	- prop functions => child can trigger parent defined logic
	- children prop => rendering JSX inside child component 
	- JSX/component prop => inject render logic
	- context api => avoid prop drilling
	- redux => global state 

# 41. How do you optimize your react application ?
	we can optimize react application using below methods 
		- code splitting 
		- memoization using useMemo, useCallback and React.memo
		- visualization using React.lazy 
		- avoid rerenders 
		- CDN ( content delivery network ) 
		- debouncing

# 42. How would you consume a RESTful JSON API in reactjs?
	using axios and fetch and async/await in useEffect 

# 49. What are the different types of exports and imports ?
 	Types of exports 
		named exports => when we import then use {} and exact name can pass and multiple exports within same components
		default exports => when we import then don;t use {} and you can rename component while importing and only one export per component

	Types of imports 
		Named imports, 
		default imports 
		named and default imports

# 47. what are the different hooks you have used ?
	- useState :
		- useState is a react hook that allow functional component to maintain and update local state
		- useState allows us to track state in functional component 
		- useState is used for simple or independent state ( like tracking user input forms, and toggling UI element)
		- useState accepts initial value and returns array with 2 items
			1. current state 
			2. setter function to update that state
		- Syntax : const [state,setState] = usestate(initialValue)
	
	- useReducer : 
		- useReducer is alternative of useState 
		- useReducer is a react hook that allow functional component to managing complex state logic, especially when state updated depends on previous state or multiple actions 4
		- useReducer works by using a reducer function to handle state transition
		- The reducer takes the current state and an action and returns new state
		- useReducer hooks used when complex state logic and when multiple values are updated together (like form validation, redo/undo, ) 
		- syntax : const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducerFunction, initialValue)

	- useEffect : 
		- useEffect runs asynchronously
		- useEffect is a react hook that let you perform side effect in functional component - like fetching data , subscribing to the events or updating the DOM.
 		- It is similar to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount from class component
		- you pass it a function that runs after render(after DOM paints). It also returns a cleanup functions for unmounting 
		- There are 3 ways to use useEffects 
			1. No dependency array : runs function on every render 
			2. empty dependency array : runs only once like componentDidMount
			3. passed dependency array : run when value changes ( used for search items, filter, or prop changes)

	- useLayoutEffect
		- useLayoutEffect runs synchronously
		- useLayoutEffect is a react hook that works like same useEffect but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations and before browser paints the screen
		- used for DOM measurements 
		- when you want to synchronously update layout before the screen paints

	- useMemo
		- useMemo is a react hook that memoize the value, so its only recalculated when dependencies changes. This improves performance. 
		- useMemo is react hook that memoizes the result of a function so its only recalculated when they needed. 
		- It improves performance by avoiding expensive or repeated calculations on every render 
		- useMemo takes 2 arguments 
			1. the 1st argument is a function that returns a value 
			2. the 2nd argument is dependency array 
			3. react remembers the value from the previous render and only re-runs the function if dependencies (a,b) have changed.
		- useMemo is used when you have a computationally expensive function

	- useCallback	
		- useCallback is a react hook that memoize a function - it returns the same function reference between renders unless dependencies change.
		- it helps avoid unnecessary re-creation of function which is useful when passing callbacks to child component that rely on reference equality (like react.Memo).
		- work :
			- define a function inside useCallback 
			- passed dependency array 
			- react will re-create the function only when one of dependencies changes 
			- otherwise it returns a same function instance helping to avoid unnecessary renders.
		- it is used when you can pass a function as a prop to React.memo components.
		- when your component has frequent renders and you want to optimize performance. 
		- the function is used in event handlers, effect or callbacks that depends om stable references.
 
	- useContext
		- useContext is a react hook that let you access values from content directly without needing a <Context.Consumer> wrapper.
		- it is used to share global data ( like themes, authentication or language) across many components without passing props manually.
		- work : 
			1. create a context
			2. wrap your component with a provider 
			3. access the values with useContext.

	- useRef
		- useRef is a react hook that returns mutable object which persists for the entire lifetime of a component.
		- its mainly used to 
			- access DOM elements 
			- store mutable values that don't trigger re-render.
		- syntax : const myRef = useRef(initialValue)
			- useRef returns an object 
			- you can read/write to myRef.current without causing a re-render
			- the object remains same between renders 
		- uses : 
			- referencing DOM nodes ( eg. focus, scroll, animations)
			- storing mutable variables between renders 
			- avoiding re-renders that happens with useState
			- storing previous values ( like a previous props or state)
	
	

# 7. What is component life cycle of React class component ?
	Component life cycle methods are special methods that get called at various stages of component life cycle 
	There are 3 phases 
	1. Mounting phase 
	2. Updating phase
	3. Unmounting phase 
	
	1. Mounting phase : In Mounting phase, when component is created and added to the DOM 
	there are 4 methods 
		1. constructor
		2. getDerivedStateFromProps
		3. render
		4. componentDidMount => useEffect with empty dependecy array

	2. updating phase : in updating phase , state and props has changed
	There are 5 methods 
		1. getDerivedStateFromProps
		2. shouldComponentUpdate
		3. render
		4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
		5. componentDidUpdate => useEffect with dependency array passed

	3. Unmounting phase : in unmounting phase, component is removed and used for cleanup
	There are only one method 
		1. componentWillUnmount => useEffect with return 


# 32. What is context in react ?
	Context in React is a way to share data globally across your component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.
		

# 2. What is useMemo ?

# 25. What are the differences between useMemo and useCallback ?
# 34. What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?
	In React, especially when using class components, the setState() method accepts a second argument, which is a callback function that gets executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.

# 36. Which lifecycle hooks in class component are replaced with useEffect in functional components ?

| **Class Component Lifecycle**              | **Replaced by `useEffect`**                      | **Explanation**                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `componentDidMount()`                      | `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])`                   | Runs once after the component mounts             |
| `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)` | `useEffect(() => { ... }, [deps])`               | Runs after the component updates (based on deps) |
| `componentWillUnmount()`                   | `useEffect(() => { return () => { ... }; }, [])` | Cleanup function runs when component unmounts    |


# 37. What is Strict mode in react ?
	React Strict Mode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in a React application. 
    It doesn’t render any UI and has no effect on the production build — it’s purely for development.

# 43. different design patterns used in react?
Presentational and Container Components
Higher-Order Components (HOC)
Render Props Pattern
Custom Hooks
Compound Components Pattern
Provider Pattern (Context API)
State Reducer Pattern

# 44. context api vs redux
| Feature                | Context API                      | Redux                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**            | Share global data (simple state) | Manage complex, large-scale app state     |
| **Built-in**           | ✅ Yes (React API)                | ❌ No (external library)                   |
| **Boilerplate**        | Minimal                          | More verbose (actions, reducers, store)   |
| **DevTools**           | ❌ No (manual setup)              | ✅ Yes (Redux DevTools)                    |
| **Middleware Support** | ❌ No built-in                    | ✅ Yes (`redux-thunk`, `redux-saga`, etc.) |
| **Performance**        | May re-render many components    | More control over updates                 |
| **Best For**           | Theme, auth, user settings       | Large apps with complex logic             |


# 45. prop types in react(How to apply validation on props in react)
	In React, PropTypes are used to validate the data types of props a component receives. This helps catch bugs during development by ensuring that the right kind of data is passed.
	PropTypes only work in development — they do not affect production performance or behavior.


# 46. What are React Mixins ?
	React Mixins were a pattern used to share reusable logic between class components before modern features like Hooks and Higher-Order Components (HOCs) became standard.
	⚠️ Mixins are deprecated in modern React. They only worked with React.createClass, not ES6 classes.
	A mixin is an object that contains reusable methods or lifecycle hooks that can be shared among multiple components.
	Think of it like copy-pasting common behavior into components automatically.



# 48. What are render props in react ?
	Render Props is a pattern in React where a component uses a function as a prop to determine what to render
	This allows code reuse and dynamic rendering logic, especially for sharing stateful logic between components — similar to what you might use hooks for today.
