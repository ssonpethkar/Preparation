<!-- $ is a variable 
    $$ is variable of varible. its treat as a reference variable and value is used as a variable  -->
## Difference between $ and $$
<?php
    $name = "Swati";
    $$name = "IN Parali";
    echo $name;
    echo $$name;
    echo $name ." ". $Swati;
?>


## is PHP supports nested class 
 No, Php doesn't support nested class but its supports anonymous class

Nested class => refers to a class defined inside another class. this is also called as inner class

anonymous class => Anonymous class is a class that is defined without a name. It is used when we don't need
ex . 
return new class{

}

## php is asynchronous or synchronous
PHP is synchronous. It means that PHP will execute one line of code at a time. It does not support asynchronous programming out of the box. However, you can use third-party libraries like ReactPHP or Amp to achieve asynchronous programming in PHP.


## to check type of variable in php 
gettype() and var_dump() 
additionally is_int(), is_string(), etc.

## to check type of variable in javascript
typeof and instanceof
Using Array.isArray() => To check specifically if a variable is an array.


## 1. What is PHP?
Answer: PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular open-source server-side scripting language used primarily for web development. It is embedded in HTML and is known for its ability to generate dynamic content on the web. PHP scripts are executed on the server, and the result is sent to the browser as plain HTML.

## 2. What are the differences between echo and print in PHP?
Answer:

Both echo and print are used to output data to the screen.
echo can take multiple parameters, while print can only take one argument.
echo does not return any value, whereas print always returns 1.
echo is slightly faster than print.

    echo "Hello", " World!"; // Valid
    print "Hello World!";     // Valid


## 3. Explain the difference between == and === in PHP.
Answer:

== is used to check if two values are equal, ignoring their data types.
=== is used to check if two values are equal and of the same data type (strict comparison).

    $a = "10";
    $b = 10;

    var_dump($a == $b); // true
    var_dump($a === $b); // false


## 4. What is a session in PHP? How is it different from a cookie?
Answer:

A session in PHP is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages. Session data is stored on the server.

A cookie is a small file stored on the user's computer. It can be used to track information between pages, but it is less secure than a session.

Session:
    Data is stored on the server.
    More secure.
    Larger data can be stored.

Cookie:
    Data is stored in the user's browser.
    Less secure.
    Limited to about 4KB of data.


## 5. What are the major differences between GET and POST methods in PHP?
Answer:

GET:
    Data is sent via URL.
    Limited to 2048 characters.
    Less secure as data is visible in the URL.
    Suitable for data retrieval operations.
POST:
    Data is sent in the body of the HTTP request.
    No size limitations for data.
    More secure as data is not visible in the URL.
    Suitable for data modification operations.


## 6. What is an associative array in PHP?
Answer: An associative array is an array that uses named keys instead of numeric keys. Each key is associated with a specific value.


    $person = [
        "name" => "John",
        "age" => 30,
        "gender" => "male"
    ];

    echo $person["name"]; // Outputs: John


## 7. How can you redirect a user to a different page in PHP?
Answer: You can redirect a user to a different page using the header() function. Remember to call exit() after the redirection to prevent further code execution.

    header("Location: http://www.example.com/");
    exit();


## 8. What are the differences between include, require, include_once, and require_once?
Answer:

include: 
    Includes and evaluates a specified file. If the file is not found, it will produce a warning but the script will continue.
require: 
    Similar to include, but if the file is not found, it will produce a fatal error and stop the script.
include_once: 
    Ensures that the file is included only once during the execution of the script, even if called multiple times.
require_once: 
    Similar to include_once, but it will cause a fatal error if the file cannot be included.



## 9. Explain the concept of namespaces in PHP.
Answer: Namespaces in PHP are a way to encapsulate items such as classes, functions, and constants to avoid naming conflicts in large applications. They are particularly useful when integrating code from different libraries.


    namespace MyNamespace;

    class MyClass {
        public function sayHello() {
            echo "Hello!";
        }
    }

    $obj = new \MyNamespace\MyClass();
    $obj->sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello!


## 10. How do you connect to a MySQL database using PHP?
Answer: You can connect to a MySQL database using either the mysqli extension or the PDO (PHP Data Objects) extension. Hereâ€™s an example using mysqli:

    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "username";
    $password = "password";
    $dbname = "database";

    // Create connection
    $conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

    // Check connection
    if ($conn->connect_error) {
        die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
    }
    echo "Connected successfully";


## 11. What is Composer, and why is it used in PHP?
Answer: Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. It allows you to manage libraries that your project depends on. Composer handles dependencies, installs, updates them, and also loads autoload files for easy class loading.


## 12. What is the difference between == and ===?
Answer: == is the equality operator, which checks if two values are equal, ignoring their data types. === is the identity operator, which checks if two values are equal and of the same data type.


## 13. What are Traits in PHP?
Answer: Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in PHP. They allow you to include methods in multiple classes, even if those classes do not inherit from a common parent. Traits are similar to multiple inheritance in other languages.

    trait SayHello {
        public function sayHello() {
            echo "Hello!";
        }
    }

    class MyClass {
        use SayHello;
    }

    $obj = new MyClass();
    $obj->sayHello(); // Outputs: Hello!


## 14. How does PHP handle error and exception handling?
Answer:
Errors: 
    PHP has a default error-handling mechanism, which outputs errors to the screen. You can control this using error_reporting() and set_error_handler() functions.

Exceptions: 
    PHP supports exceptions using try, catch, and throw blocks. Exceptions can be used for handling runtime errors in a more structured way.

    try {
        if (some_condition) {
            throw new Exception("An error occurred");
        }
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        echo 'Caught exception: ',  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
    }


## 15. What are prepared statements and why should you use them?
Answer: Prepared statements are used in PHP to execute SQL queries more securely. They help prevent SQL injection by separating the query from its data. With prepared statements, placeholders are used in the SQL query, and the actual data is bound to these placeholders at execution time.

    $stmt = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)");
    $stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $email);
    $stmt->execute();


## 16. How does PHP handle sessions?
Answer: PHP manages sessions using a unique session ID, which is stored in a cookie or passed in the URL. Session data is stored on the server, and the session ID links the user's browser to the session data. You can start a session with session_start() and access session variables using the $_SESSION superglobal.

    session_start();
    $_SESSION['username'] = 'JohnDoe';


## 17. What is the difference between unlink() and unset() in PHP?
Answer:

unlink(): Used to delete a file from the filesystem.
unset(): Used to destroy a variable or remove an element from an array.

## 18. What is the __construct() method in PHP?
Answer: The __construct() method is a special function in PHP that acts as a constructor. It is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize objects with default values.


    class MyClass {
        public $name;

        public function __construct($name) {
            $this->name = $name;
        }
    }

    $obj = new MyClass("John");
    echo $obj->name; // Outputs: John


## 19. What is $_SERVER in PHP?
Answer: $_SERVER is a superglobal array in PHP that contains information about headers, paths, and script locations. For example, $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] gives you the request method used to access the page (GET, POST, etc.).


## 20. Explain the use of explode() and implode() functions in PHP.
Answer:

explode(): Splits a string into an array based on a delimiter.

    $str = "one,two,three";
    $arr = explode(",", $str); // $arr is ["one", "two", "three"]

implode(): Joins array elements into a string with a delimiter.

    $arr = ["one", "two", "three"];
    $str = implode(",", $arr); // $str is "one,two,three"

## difference between isset() and empty()




## Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in PHP.

# Classes and Objects:

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have.
An object is an instance of a class. When an object is created, it inherits all the properties and methods of the class.

    class Car {
        public $make;
        public $model;

        public function startEngine() {
            echo "Engine started!";
        }
    }

    $myCar = new Car(); // Creating an object (instance) of the Car class
    $myCar->make = "Toyota";
    $myCar->model = "Corolla";
    $myCar->startEngine(); // Calling a method of the Car object
    Properties and Methods:

Properties are variables that belong to a class. They define the characteristics of the objects.
Methods are functions that belong to a class. They define the actions that the objects can perform.

# Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (properties) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is achieved using visibility keywords like public, protected, and private.
    - Public members can be accessed from anywhere.
    - Protected members can be accessed only within the class itself and by inheriting classes.
    - Private members can only be accessed within the class itself.

    class Car {
        private $engineStatus = false;

        public function startEngine() {
            $this->engineStatus = true;
            echo "Engine started!";
        }

        public function getEngineStatus() {
            return $this->engineStatus;
        }
    }

    $myCar = new Car();
    $myCar->startEngine();
    echo $myCar->getEngineStatus(); // Accessing private property through a public method

# Inheritance:

Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.
php
Copy code
    class Vehicle {
        public $wheels = 4;

        public function startEngine() {
            echo "Engine started!";
        }
    }

    class Car extends Vehicle {
        public $make;
        public $model;
    }

    $myCar = new Car();
    echo $myCar->wheels; // Inherited property
    $myCar->startEngine(); // Inherited method

# Polymorphism:

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. It also allows a method to be implemented in different ways in different classes.
Method overriding is a common example where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

    class Vehicle {
        public function startEngine() {
            echo "Vehicle engine started!";
        }
    }

    class Car extends Vehicle {
        public function startEngine() { // Overriding the parent method
            echo "Car engine started!";
        }
    }

    $myCar = new Car();
    $myCar->startEngine(); // Calls the overridden method in the Car class

# Abstraction:

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In PHP, this can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
An abstract class cannot be instantiated and often includes abstract methods that must be implemented by child classes.
An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must follow, specifying methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.

    abstract class Vehicle {
        abstract public function startEngine(); // Abstract method
    }

    class Car extends Vehicle {
        public function startEngine() {
            echo "Car engine started!";
        }
    }

    interface Movable {
        public function move();
    }

    class Car implements Movable {
        public function move() {
            echo "Car is moving!";
        }
    }

Advantages of OOP in PHP

    - Code Reusability: Inheritance allows for the reuse of existing code, reducing redundancy.
    - Modularity: Code is organized into classes, making it easier to manage and update.
    - Maintainability: Encapsulation ensures that the internal workings of a class are hidden, making it easier to change the class's implementation without affecting other parts of the code.
    - Extensibility: New functionalities can be easily added by extending existing classes.


## What are the different visibility keywords in PHP( (also known as access modifiers)?

PHP supports three visibility keywords: 
# 1. public : Accessible from anywhere.
    Public properties and methods can be accessed from outside the class, within the class itself, and by inheriting classes.

    class Example {
        public $publicVar = "I am public!";

        public function showPublic() {
            echo $this->publicVar;
        }
    }

    $example = new Example();
    echo $example->publicVar;  // Accessible outside the class
    $example->showPublic();    // Accessible outside the class


# 2. protected : Accessible within the class itself and by inheriting (child) classes, but not from outside the class.
    Protected members are often used when you want to allow access to a property or method by child classes but hide it from the outside world.

    class Example {
        protected $protectedVar = "I am protected!";

        protected function showProtected() {
            echo $this->protectedVar;
        }
    }

    class ChildExample extends Example {
        public function display() {
            echo $this->protectedVar;  // Accessible within the child class
            $this->showProtected();    // Accessible within the child class
        }
    }

    $child = new ChildExample();
    $child->display();  // Works
    // echo $child->protectedVar;  // Error: Cannot access protected property
    // $child->showProtected();    // Error: Cannot access protected method

# 3. private : Accessible only within the class that defines them.
    Private members cannot be accessed by child classes or from outside the class. They are used to encapsulate and protect the internal state of an object.

    class Example {
        private $privateVar = "I am private!";

        private function showPrivate() {
            echo $this->privateVar;
        }

        public function accessPrivate() {
            $this->showPrivate();  // Accessible within the class
        }
    }

    $example = new Example();
    $example->accessPrivate();  // Works: Calls a public method that accesses a private method
    // echo $example->privateVar;  // Error: Cannot access private property
    // $example->showPrivate();    // Error: Cannot access private method

## Summary of Visibility Keywords:
Public: Accessible from anywhere (inside the class, by child classes, and outside the class).
Protected: Accessible within the class itself and by child classes, but not from outside the class.
Private: Accessible only within the class that defines it, not by child classes or outside the class.


## How do you implement inheritance in PHP?

Inheritance in PHP allows a class (known as the child class or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (known as the parent class or superclass). This concept is fundamental to object-oriented programming and enables code reuse and the creation of more complex systems by building on existing classes.

In the above example:

The Car class inherits the make, model properties and the startEngine() method from the Vehicle class.
The Car class also adds its own property doors and method openTrunk().

    // Parent class
    class Vehicle {
        public $make;
        public $model;

        public function startEngine() {
            echo "Engine started!";
        }
    }

    // Child class inheriting from the Vehicle class
    class Car extends Vehicle {
        public $doors;

        public function openTrunk() {
            echo "Trunk opened!";
        }
    }

    // Creating an object of the Car class
    $myCar = new Car();
    $myCar->make = "Toyota";  // Inherited property
    $myCar->model = "Corolla"; // Inherited property
    $myCar->doors = 4;  // Property of the Car class

    $myCar->startEngine();  // Inherited method
    $myCar->openTrunk();  // Method of the Car class


# Overriding Methods:
Child classes can also override methods inherited from the parent class to provide a specific implementation.

    class Vehicle {
        public function startEngine() {
            echo "Vehicle engine started!";
        }
    }

    class Car extends Vehicle {
        public function startEngine() {  // Overriding the parent method
            echo "Car engine started!";
        }
    }

    $myCar = new Car();
    $myCar->startEngine();  // Output: "Car engine started!"

In this case, the startEngine() method in the Car class overrides the startEngine() method in the Vehicle class.
