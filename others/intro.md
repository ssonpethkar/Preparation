# about project 

In my recent project, I worked on a Reverse Logistics platform.

The main objective of this project was to calculate grading and values using functional tests and display live data in real-time. We also integrated an auction system, allowing for seamless bidding and transactions. Additionally, the project involved monitoring hardware machines through a web portal, ensuring smooth operations and providing insights into machine performance.4









I have a strong command of JavaScript and always love exploring new technologies.
Apart from work, I enjoy trekking and surfing the internet to try new things.

<!-- Apart from my professional work, I love trekking and exploring new things on the internet. In fact, my interest in online platforms led me to open a seller account for my father's business, making us the first seller from my city on that platform. -->

That's a little about me. Thank you! 



In my recent project, I have worked with Kafka, MQTT, and WebSockets for real-time data processing and communication.

Coming to my family, we are four membersâ€”my mother, elder sister, and younger brother.
